# About Me

I'm an instructional designer and learning experience strategist who bridges technology, creativity, and pedagogy. With a foundation in K–12 education, I specialize in designing learning environments that are interactive, inclusive, and grounded in real-world application.

My work blends curriculum design with hands-on tools like micro:bit and Scratch, supporting students and educators in telling stories, solving problems, and thinking computationally. Whether I’m leading a professional development session or architecting a digital learning journey, I’m driven by the belief that meaningful learning happens when creativity meets structure.

I bring experience across digital storytelling, physical computing, and standards-aligned curriculum development — always with an eye on access, equity, and engagement.
