## 🧠 Overview

The **Digital Citizens Pathway** was developed in collaboration with **Teachers College, Columbia University** through the **TR@TC Global Citizens initiative**. Originally launched during the pivot to virtual learning in 2020, the program has evolved into a rich, in-person learning experience where students engage in civic and environmental problem-solving through interdisciplinary study.

Participants investigate real issues in their communities—such as **noise pollution**, **green space access**, and **environmental justice**—and use **data, digital tools, and design thinking** to prototype creative and impactful solutions.

## 🔧 My Role

**Curriculum Designer, Site Director, and Instructional Support**  
in partnership with **Teachers College, Columbia University**

- Designed and scaffolded a 4-week summer learning experience  
- Integrated ELA, Life Science, and CS/CT standards across daily activities  
- Supported facilitation of field visits, design thinking cycles, and solution prototyping  
- Coached educators and aligned project rubrics with equity-focused goals  
- Partnered with TC faculty and instructional leads to support student-centered implementation

---

## 📚 Curriculum Focus Areas

- **Computer Science**: Computational thinking, data literacy, basic coding, physical computing  
- **Life Science**: Environmental impact, sustainability, local ecosystems  
- **ELA**: Research, inquiry-based writing, persuasive communication  
- **Design Thinking**: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test

## 🧭 Program Flow & Key Learning Phases

### Week 1: Community, Context & Environmental Justice  
- Observation walks and environmental justice framing  
- Site visits and Indigenous lens discussions  
- Photo documentation and group norms

### Week 2: Research, Interviews & Site Selection  
- Interviews, data collection, and site-based focus  
- Initial community issue framing and share-outs

### Week 3: Prototyping & Computational Problem-Solving  
- Students chose low/no/high tech strategies  
- Developed working prototypes using sensors, VR, or campaign tools

### Week 4: Final Builds, Shark Tank & Presentations  
- Peer feedback, final reflections, and public demonstrations  
- Presented to partners and connected to city-wide EJ goals

## 💡 Example Projects

- **Noise pollution sensors** to map sound data  
- **Advocacy websites** focused on public access to parks  
- **VR and 3D mockups** of future green spaces  
- **Community resource maps** with crowdsourced visuals

---

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms Used

- micro:bit, MakeCode, Scratch  
- Google Docs/Slides, Canva, Padlet  
- Solar panels, sensors, VR tools, poster boards

---

## 🧩 Standards Alignment

- **CS4All Blueprint**: Algorithms, iteration, decomposition  
- **ELA Standards**: Research, evidence-based writing  
- **NGSS**: Human-environmental impact, inquiry and analysis

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- Students earned **SYEP stipends** and some received **school credit**  
- Student work shared in community showcases  
- Teachers adopted interdisciplinary routines and CT/ELA integration strategies  
- Projects led to extended inquiry even after the program

## 🧠 Design Thinking in Action

The program leaned heavily on strategies outlined in the **IDEO Design Thinking for Educators Toolkit**, including:

- **Stakeholder Mapping**  
  Students identified who was impacted by their chosen community issue and mapped relationships, influence, and potential collaboration.

- **Point of View Statements**  
  Used to help students turn raw observations into user-centered design questions. This reframing supported student empathy and focus.

- **Rapid Prototyping**  
  Encouraged students to sketch, build, and test early-stage versions of their ideas using both digital tools and everyday classroom materials.

- **Feedback Capture Grids**  
  Used during peer critique and presentation prep to structure input in a way that promoted useful revision, iteration, and next steps.

These strategies aligned seamlessly with the program's inquiry-driven approach and made abstract design processes tangible for students and teachers alike.
