## ðŸ§  Overview

The **Digital Citizens Pathway** was first developed as part of TR@TCâ€™s Global Citizens initiative during the pivot to virtual learning in 2020. Originally launched as a virtual summer experience, this interdisciplinary program integrates **Computer Science**, **Life Science**, and **ELA Common Core standards** to help students explore and address real-world urban challenges.

Students were encouraged to investigate issues in their communitiesâ€”such as **noise pollution**, **limited access to parks**, and **environmental justice**â€”and to use data and design thinking strategies to propose innovative solutions using computational tools.

## ðŸ“š Curriculum Focus Areas

- **Computer Science**: Data collection, prototyping, basic coding (web and hardware-based tools)  
- **Life Science**: Urban ecosystems, environmental monitoring, sustainability  
- **ELA**: Community research, persuasive writing, oral presentation  
- **Design Thinking**: Empathize â†’ Define â†’ Ideate â†’ Prototype â†’ Test

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example Projects

- Designing **noise pollution sensors** using physical computing  
- Building **advocacy websites** promoting green space in urban areas  
- Creating **interactive community maps** to highlight access gaps in public resources  

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Platforms Used

- Microcontrollers (e.g., micro:bit, Arduino for prototyping)  
- Scratch & MakeCode (coding environments)  
- Google Forms, Sheets (data gathering + analysis)  
- Padlet, Canva, and Wakelet (for student publishing and presentation)

---

## ðŸ§© Standards Alignment

- **NYC CS4All Blueprint**  
  - Computational Thinking practices (e.g., decomposition, iteration, debugging)  
- **ELA Next Gen Learning Standards**  
  - Evidence-based writing, public speaking, reading for purpose  
- **NGSS**  
  - Environmental science and human impact

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes

- Students demonstrated increased agency and interest in civic problem-solving  
- Teachers gained confidence in interdisciplinary teaching and technology integration  
- Student projects were showcased in community forums and shared with partner organizations like **NYC Parks Department**  
- **Participants received compensation** through the **NYC Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP)** for their project work  
- **Some students also earned school credit** for their completed submissions and final presentations
