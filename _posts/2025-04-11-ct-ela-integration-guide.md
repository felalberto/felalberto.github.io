## ðŸ§  Overview

This **CT + ELA Byte-Sized Integration Guide** was created for **Cornell Tech** to support NYC teachers in embedding **Computational Thinking (CT)** practices into daily ELA instruction.

As schools face mounting pressure to prioritize ELA and Math proficiency, thereâ€™s a real risk that computer science instruction â€” particularly CT â€” gets deprioritized. This guide offers a **lightweight, flexible framework** that keeps CT active during literacy blocks, without requiring full coding lessons or tech-heavy setups.

## ðŸ”§ My Role

**Curriculum Designer** for Cornell Tech

- Designed the overall concept and structure of the integration guide  
- Aligned CT concepts with key literacy practices to ensure relevance and usability  
- Created examples that are adaptable, standards-aligned, and grounded in classroom realities  
- Piloted and refined the guide based on educator feedback and use across NYC schools

## ðŸ“˜ Why This Guide Matters

- Developed to **meet the needs of NYC public school teachers**  
- Ensures CT continues to be taught alongside ELA during high-stakes instructional periods  
- Promotes **equity of access** to CS concepts, even without full CS scheduling  
- Helps teachers **recognize and name CT thinking** already embedded in their literacy practices

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Integration Examples

- **Summarizing a story** â†’ Abstraction (identifying the most important parts)  
- **Predicting a characterâ€™s next move** â†’ Algorithms (logic and step-by-step reasoning)  
- **Breaking down a writing task** â†’ Decomposition (draft, revise, edit stages)  
- **Finding rhymes or sentence patterns** â†’ Pattern Recognition

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes

The guide has been distributed across NYC through Cornell Techâ€™s educational initiatives. Itâ€™s used in PD, coaching, and classroom support to help schools balance literacy mandates with computational thinking outcomes.

Teachers report itâ€™s helped them **infuse CT concepts without sacrificing ELA instructional time**, and has supported broader CS-for-all goals across literacy-focused classrooms.
