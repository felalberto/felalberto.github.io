excerpt: "Designed and led a 3-day PD series integrating CS and ELA using digital storytelling. Teachers created animated Scratch narratives from written stories."

## 🧠 Overview

This professional development series was part of NYC’s **CS4All initiative**, and designed to support elementary educators in integrating **digital storytelling** with **computational thinking** and **coding in Scratch**.

I co-designed and facilitated a 3-day experience during mid-winter recess that guided teachers through the process of turning written narratives into interactive digital projects — all while aligning to CS and ELA standards.

## 🔧 My Role

**Instructional Designer, Facilitator, and Content Creator**

- Designed the workshop flow using the **ADDIE model**
- Co-developed the entire slide deck, demo projects, and handouts
- Modeled live code-alongs and storytelling breakdowns
- Facilitated teacher collaboration in Zoom breakouts and Padlet/Wakelet shares

## 🧭 Structure of the 3-Day PD

### 🟡 Day 1: Introduction to Digital Storytelling & Scratch  
- Defined key concepts of digital storytelling and computational thinking  
- Deconstructed a model story (“The Fish and the Cat”)  
- Introduced core Scratch elements (sprites, backgrounds, blocks)  
- Practiced decomposing stories into scenes and actions  

### 🟢 Day 2: Storyboarding, Coding & Collaboration  
- Used planning templates to storyboard scenes and identify key actions  
- Led a “code-along” building the first scene with motion, dialogue, and timing  
- Supported participants in breakout rooms for peer feedback  
- Curated teacher drafts in Wakelet for discussion  

### 🔵 Day 3: Extensions & Classroom Implementation  
- Explored Scratch features like loops, conditionals, and broadcasts  
- Modeled how to scaffold student use of planning sheets  
- Facilitated conversation about standards alignment and classroom rollout  
- Collected final share-outs and feedback

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms Used

- **Scratch** (student projects and facilitator demo)
- **Google Slides** (visuals, instruction flow)
- **Padlet & Wakelet** (collaborative boards for reflection & drafts)
- **Zoom** (live facilitation, code-alongs, breakout discussions)
- **Bit.ly** (shortlink access to materials)

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- Teachers left with a completed Scratch story prototype and classroom-ready materials
- Many participants adapted the unit to their narrative writing blocks
- Received positive feedback for the modeling pace, access to templates, and integration of SEL through storytelling

---

## 📁 Sample Deliverables (Redacted for Privacy)

- 🎨 Story planning template (with character + scene map)
- 🧩 Scratch block breakdown and “starter code” demo
- 🗂 Wakelet project gallery for peer showcase
- 🗣 Facilitator slide decks with meme-based icebreakers, direct instruction, and visuals

## 💬 Reflection

This project showcased how **code can be a canvas for creative expression**. By positioning students as storytellers *and* programmers, we built confidence in teachers who previously saw CS as inaccessible.

The workshop also demonstrated how well-designed eLearning can blend pedagogy, technology, and joy — even over Zoom.
