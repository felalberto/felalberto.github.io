## 🧠 Overview

This project involved designing a **5-unit project-based computing curriculum** for upper elementary grades (3–5) that introduces students to physical computing through the **micro:bit**.

The curriculum focused on creativity, problem-solving, and user-centered design. Each unit scaffolded technical skills and computational thinking concepts while supporting classroom integration across literacy, SEL, and STEM.

## 🔧 My Role

**Lead Curriculum Designer and Standards-Aligned Content Developer**

- Developed unit goals, essential questions, rubrics, and activities
- Designed student handouts, code samples, and unplugged warm-ups
- Wrote assessment tasks aligned to NYC’s CS4All standards
- Iteratively tested and revised materials with teacher feedback

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

### 📘 Unit 1: Fantasy Device Design
- Students ideate and prototype imaginative “smart” devices using buttons, LEDs, and input events
- Explores physical inputs and how computers respond to user interactions
- Includes visual planning maps and storytelling integration

### 📘 Unit 2: LED-Based Interactive Storytelling
- Students build micro:bit animations that tell stories with light and movement
- Focuses on sequencing, loops, and design planning
- Connects to ELA concepts like beginning/middle/end and character reactions

### 📘 Unit 3: Music Players and Sound Design
- Introduces sound blocks and input/output coordination
- Projects include data-driven beat generators and mood-driven melody players

### 📘 Unit 4: Multiplayer Game Design (Radio Communication)
- Students build and debug a “Hot Potato” or “Bop It” style multiplayer game using micro:bit radio
- Focuses on variables, conditional logic, and player interaction design

### 📘 Unit 5: Publishing Student Tutorials
- Students write tutorials for their favorite project, using visuals, diagrams, and code walkthroughs
- Encourages reflection, audience thinking, and real-world documentation skills

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms Used

- **MakeCode Editor** (block-based programming)
- **micro:bit** (hardware device for physical computing)
- **Google Docs & Slides** (planning templates and lesson materials)
- **Planning sheets & rubrics** (student-facing + teacher guides)

---

## 🧩 Standards Alignment

- Designed to meet **NYC’s CS4All Blueprint** and **Digital Fluency** goals
- Embedded **Computational Thinking** practices:
  - Algorithmic thinking
  - Iterative design
  - Decomposition
  - Debugging
- Mapped to **Next Generation ELA** and **Math Practices** (e.g., modeling, attending to precision)

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

- Piloted with multiple classrooms; students showed strong engagement and ownership
- Teachers reported improved confidence teaching CS without prior experience
- Materials published through CS4All Blueprint and adapted for other grade bands

---

## 📁 Sample Deliverables (Redacted for Privacy)

- 📘 Full unit overviews and lesson sequences
- 📋 Planning and reflection templates for students
- 🧪 Debugging challenge cards
- 🎮 MakeCode demo files and remixable projects

---

## 💬 Reflection

This project let me combine **instructional design**, **maker education**, and **standards-based learning** into a highly modular, joyful curriculum. By framing code as a medium for storytelling, problem-solving, and expression, we made physical computing accessible and exciting — especially for students new to CS.
